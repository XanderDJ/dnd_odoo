# Main overview of dnd system in Odoo
> Documentation can be outdated and subject to change

The objective of this repository is to implement different dnd systems into Odoo. First system to be implemented will be the current edition of DND 5e which is made by Wizards of the coast (WOTC).
DND will be split up into different modules to allow for more easily adapting and adding different systems to the base layer of this project.
The base layer should only contain basic elements like items, characters, races, enemies and locations.
